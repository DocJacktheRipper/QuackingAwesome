GameLAB 2020

How to set up:

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Start it. Log in.
3. Click "clone repository". Use this url.
4. Open Unity Hub. Click "Add".
5. Navigate to the GitHub repository.

How to work:

1. For big or unsafe changes, create a new branch.
2. As long as a feature isn't working yet, just use "commit"
3. When you want everyone else to have the version too, use "push"

Rules for commits:

- commit/push only things, that don't have errors in it!
(The new feature doesn't need to work well yet, but shouldn't cause errors in console either.)

- always add a useful summary-titles! 
(no 'lol' or 'I did sth')

- If it's a big feature, add a despription to explain.
